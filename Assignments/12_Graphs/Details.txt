Problem Statement: Model a simplified map of a city using a directed weighted graph. Each vertex
represents a location (e.g., hospital, school, store), and each edge represents a one-way road with a given
travel time.
Tasks:
1. Build a class-based graph implementation.
2. Populate the graph with at least 6 locations and 10 roads.
3. Implement:
	A function to add/remove locations and roads.
	A function to compute the shortest path from one location to another (use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm).
	A function to list all reachable locations from a starting point (use BFS).
