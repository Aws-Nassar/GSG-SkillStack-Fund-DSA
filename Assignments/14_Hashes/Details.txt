Implement a hash table from scratch without using built-in dictionary types, supporting the following
operations:

	insert(key, value)
	delete(key)
	search(key)
	Automatic rehashing when the load factor exceeds 0.7.
	Use quadratic probing as the collision resolution strategy, ensuring that probing steps follow the quadratic sequence (iÂ²) from the initial hash index.
